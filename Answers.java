 * 1. What does it mean that Java AWT is platform dependent?
Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) is platform dependent because it uses native code (i.e., it relies on the operating system’s built-in GUI components). When you create a button or window using AWT, it’s actually a wrapper around the native OS widget (like a Windows button or a macOS button).


 * 2. What does it mean that Java runs on a virtual machine? How is that beneficial?
Java runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is an abstract computing machine. When you write Java code, it gets compiled into bytecode (a platform-independent intermediate language), and the JVM interprets or compiles that bytecode on the fly for the host machine.

Benefits:

Platform independence: Write once, run anywhere (as long as a JVM is available).

Security: Code runs in a controlled environment.

 * 3. In every hierarchy map of Java, Object is always at the top. Why is this so?
In Java, Object is the superclass of all classes. Every class in Java inherits from Object directly or indirectly.

 * 4. What is a Java package?
A Java package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.

Think of it like a folder on your computer that groups related files.
